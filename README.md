# 🧮 Calculator GUI Application

A simple and user-friendly **Calculator GUI Application** built using **Python** to perform basic arithmetic operations through an interactive graphical interface. This project demonstrates core programming concepts along with GUI development.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Calculator GUI Application allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** using on-screen buttons. The application is designed with a clean layout to ensure ease of use and smooth interaction.

This project focuses on understanding **event-driven programming**, GUI components, and logical implementation of arithmetic operations.

## 🔄 Application Workflow

1. User launches the calculator application
2. GUI window opens with buttons and display screen
3. User inputs numbers using buttons
4. User selects an arithmetic operator
5. Application processes the operation
6. Result is displayed on the screen
7. User can clear or continue calculations

## 🔁 Detailed Flow (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: User Input

* Button clicks capture numeric and operator input

### Step 2: Event Handling

* Each button triggers a function
* Input is stored and processed

### Step 3: Calculation Logic

* Python functions perform arithmetic operations

### Step 4: Output Display

* Result is updated on the display field
